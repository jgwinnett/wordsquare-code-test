# Pre-code thinking + planning 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie

Start with simple case - a back tracking algo that takes in a list of words and returns the valid word square(s). 

Then either:
    Calculate all valid words of length _n_ up front, feed into above algo 
    Extend the algo so instead of inputting entire words we go character by character, validating that each line is a valid word before continuing down the track.
